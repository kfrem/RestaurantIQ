Prompt: Restaurant Process Intelligence App

Title:
Restaurant Process Intelligence – Visual Cost & Profit Optimisation Platform

Objective:
Build an interactive mobile/web app that helps small and medium high-street restaurants visualise their entire business process — from raw material sourcing to post-sale customer retention — identifying where money flows, where costs accumulate, and where profits can be improved.

Core Concept:
The app is both a diagnostic and advisory dashboard. It tracks every operational stage of a restaurant’s value chain and uses data visualisation, “what-if” analysis, and recommendation algorithms to show how small adjustments (in sourcing, labour, logistics, pricing, or technology use) can improve net margins and cash flow.
Key Features:

    Process Flow Mapping

        A dynamic flowchart showing every stage of the restaurant’s process:
        Procurement → Storage → Preparation → Cooking → Service → Waste → After-sales follow-up.

        Each node displays current cost, effort (labour hours), and output metrics.

        Arrows show connections and flow of cost/value.

    Cost and Profit Visualisation

        Aggregated real-time metrics displayed in interactive charts:

            Food cost percentage, labour cost %, energy cost %, and gross margin.

            Visual breakdown via Tableau-style BI dashboards or React-based charts (Chart.js / D3.js).

        Drill-down into each cost component to see where inefficiencies appear.

    “What-If” Scenario Simulation

        Adjustable sliders or input boxes to model hypotheticals:

            “What if ingredient costs fell by 10%?”

            “What if we reduced prep time using tech X?”

            “What if online delivery increased by 15%?”

        The app recalculates expected profits and visualises impacts instantly in colour-coded charts.

    Smart Recommendations Engine

        Suggests improvements based on data patterns:

            Cheaper or more efficient suppliers nearby.

            Substitution recommendations for ingredients.

            Labour scheduling or automation tools to reduce costs.

            Marketing or retention ideas to lift repeat sales.

    Monthly Report Builder

        Generates clean, client-ready reports combining charts, analytics, and commentary.

        Reports display:

            Key highlights of performance

            Top 3 cost-saving recommendations

            Monthly comparison visuals

            Forecasted impact of implementing changes

    User & SaaS Integration

        In early phase: Used locally with single-restaurant data input.

        Later phase: Multi-tenant SaaS model allowing subscription-based access, cloud sync (Supabase or Firebase), and report sharing.

Technical Stack Suggestion:

    Frontend: React + Next.js for responsive interface

    Database: Supabase (PostgreSQL) for storing cost and process data

    Visualisation: Chart.js or D3.js for custom React dashboards

    Analytics: Python or Node.js backend with pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn for what-if modelling

    Reports: Exportable to PDF or online dashboard views (e.g. via Plotly or Tableau Public integration)

Tone and UX:

Elegant, data-driven, and intuitive. The app should allow restaurant owners to “see their business working like a machine”, where each cog (supply, labour, sales) can be tuned for better efficiency. Include simple icons, colour-coded nodes (red for loss, green for profit), and hover-over tooltips with economic insights.
Example Demonstration Flow:

    User enters or uploads cost data (ingredients, labour, sales).

    App generates a visual flowchain and BI dashboard.

    User drags a slider — “reduce waste by 5%”.

    Dashboard recalculates and shows +2% improvement in profit margin.

    At meeting’s end, user exports the monthly advisory report with visuals.

Would you like me to turn this prompt into a technical specification document (with data schema, UI layout sketches, and module breakdown) that you could hand to a developer or generate using an AI app builder?
